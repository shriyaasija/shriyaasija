### How It Works

Interested in how everything works? This project uses:

1. **GitHub Issues** - To capture player moves
2. **GitHub Actions** - Automated workflow that processes moves
3. **Python** - Game logic and state management
4. **JSON** - Storing game state between moves

Want to build your own? Check out the code in this repository!

### Making a Move Manually

If the clickable links don't work, you can create an issue manually:

1. Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Title format: `move: A1` (where A-C is row, 1-3 is column)
4. Examples: `move: A1`, `move: B2`, `move: C3`
5. Submit the issue!

To reset the game, create an issue with title: `reset`

_Last updated automatically with each move_
